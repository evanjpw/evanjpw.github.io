# Liner Notes

## Some Random Weirdo Music

It was actually very difficult to pick what to put on the playlist, but I did not want to subject you to
more than an hour of songs, so I made it just under the wire.

This is a variety, some in English, some not so much, some instrumental.

Let me know what you think.

1. *Haruomi Hosono - 薔薇と野獣 (Rose & Beast)*: This is some very fun 1970s Japanese funk. It is really infectious and weird and wonderful. It is not available on
anyhting but Japanese vinyl, so digital copies are scarce, but it is fantastic. I would love to tell you that I am just that cool that I knew all about this, but YouTube, which knows me to a scary
degree, recommended Haruomi Hosono and I ate it up. I limit myself to two songs in Japanese in this list, but there are so many more.

2. *Brothers Johnson - Strawberry Letter #23*: I love this song. It was originally written by Shuggie Otis, but the Brothers Johnson just killed it and this is
my favorite version. Pyschedelic Funk, which, as a huge Funkadelic fan, hits me where I live (right in the mitochondria).

3. *Moondog - Dog Trot*: Moondog was a homeless man with a Viking Helmet on the Streets of New York, who was also a brilliant composer. He did
so much amazing work. After he died, this track was actually used in a Lincoln Continental commercial, which I do not
think he would have aproved of.

4. *Alexandre Désilets - Changer d'air*: So, I love Quebecois pop music (there is a story there). There are *SO MANY* excellent songs in the Quebecois music
scene. I picked this one because it is an excellent song with a fun video. I limit myself to two songs in (arguably) French in this list. There are so, so many more.

5. *Steve Burns - What I Do On Saturday*: Steve Burns is "Steve", the Blues Clues Steve. He decided that what he actually wants is to be a rock star, and I
just love his music. Unfortunately, he didn't make the mainstream. However, he did excellent work solo, and is now
occupying Wayne Coyne's spot in the Flaming Lips.

6. *Astor Piazzolla - MILONGA*: I am an Astor Head. His work makes me so happy. It is full of emotion that comes in at sharp angles. This one is really
special and has a presence that shoots all the way past the intellect and into the soul, and the viscera.

7. *東京スカパラダイスオーケストラ / 美しく燃える森 (TOKYO SKA PARADISE ORCHESTRA / Beautiful Burning Forest)*: Tokyo Ska
Paradise Orchestra is so much fun and so cool. They collaborate with many artists and they produce fantatic music. This
is my favorite song of theirs. They have a very Western style, but a "Beautiful Burning Forest" feels very Japanese.

8. *The Boo Radleys - King Size*: I don't have my favorite song in here, but this is certainly a contender. I love the Boo Radleys in general, but
this is my favorite album of theirs. Back when I was married, my wife brought this back (as a physical CD) from a
business trip as a present for me. It was exactly perfect, and I listen to this album quite a bit.

9. *Duke Ellington - The Queen's Suite*:* Sunset And The Mocking Bird*: The story is that, for Queen Elisabeth's coronation,
Duke Ellington composed the _Queen's Suite_, recorded it with his band, cut exectly one record and mailed it to Queen Elisabeth, then never performed it thereafter. It is a brilliant work and this is one beautiful movement from it. I was really considering _Lotus Blossom_, which was by Ellington and Billy Strayhorn for this list (it was Ellington's favorite song), but I went with a personal favorite.

10. *Call and Response - All Night Long*: Do you know how uncool I am? I found out about _Call and Response_ from NPR.
But I love them, and their work, and this is my favorite of their songs (for which there are many contenders).

11. *NOVA - Flor De Lis*: This is a song by Djavan, an Afro-Brazillian, and a Brazillian national treasure. I listen to
so much Brazillian music that I can place accents even though I can't speak the language, and Nova has a decidedly
upper crust, but very passionate take on this song. I listen to songs with words I don't understand, but then absorb
the _sound_ of the language by osmosis and thwart myself by learning the words phonetically. I *ALWAYS* sing along with the
chorus of this one.

12. *The Ozark Mountain Daredevils ~ Spaceship Orion*: I don't even know what to say.

13. *LES TROIS ACCORDS - Les amoureux qui s'aiment*: More Quebecois, but this may be the most perfect Quebecois band ever
in the history of ever. I could provide a whole playlist just of them. Raucous, raunchy & rambunctions, and that's only
the Rs.

14. *Doctor L - Let My Baby Ride (Holy Motors (2012) Accordion Intermission)*: This is a song from a French film called Holy Motors.
It is a cover of R. L. Burnside's _"Let My Baby Ride"_, but on a mob of accordions. I love the crap out of the movie, and
maybe that is why I love the crap out of this performance.
