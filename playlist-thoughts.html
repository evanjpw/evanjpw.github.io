<h1>Playlist Thoughts</h1>

<p>I didn't want to spam your phone with a wall of text, and since I didn't know your
personal email, and it felt weird (I don't know why) to send it to your work email, I just made a page.</p>

<p>Before I say anything, I want to say thank you for the thoughtful &amp; wonderful playlist. I really
had fun listening to it. And I can see the care that you put into it, and that makes it feel special.</p>

<p>I am charmed by your eclectic taste in music, and all of the richness that was captured in your choices.
Every time there was a new track, I couldn't wait to see what treat would be next for me, and
every one made me very happy. I never knew what to expect, but it was always a delight.</p>

<p>One thing that struck me on the second run through is that you like songs with powerful images,
and so do I. I liked that quite a bit.</p>

<p>And I feel like you put a bunch of effort into the order, and that <em>really</em> worked for me. Thank you.</p>

<p>I clearly have to up my game! I am working on my next playlist for you. It is amazing
getting to know you this way, and I hope that you feel as I do.</p>

<p>That said, here are my thoughts about the songs:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Watermelon Man</em> - Of course I love this song, but before you played it for me
I had forgotten about it. It has one of those grooves that gets into your bones,
and I am so appreciative that you reintroduced me to my old friend.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Daqat</em> - This was such a fantastic surprise. It was an infectious tune, and it
just sounds so awesome. The sound of a language gives so much color to a song, and
this was nothing I was expecting but the Arabic lyrics felt perfect. I know that I
will listen to this one a lot. (Also, the whistling captured my heart.)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Cocaine Jesus</em> - I really like this one. I like that it has so many moods in one song,
and I like that it gets stuck in my head and then evolves and gets stuck again. And I like
the pictures it paints.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Back Pocket</em> - This feels like Prince in places and then it changes and keeps changing
and then it's on the playground and then clarinets and it is a wonderful ride and I keep
wanting to ride it again. This makes me smile. YouTube keeps trying to sell me Vulfpeck, and I have
not been biting. Thank you for convincing me!</p></li>
<li><p><em>Talk to the Moon</em> - Thank you so much for introducing me to Ripe. Everything I have heard
makes me want to dance and I love his voice and I love the horns (and, as a bass player, I
dig the bass lines). This makes me happy.</p></li>
<li><p><em>My Type</em> - This reminds me of a few songs that I really like, and I really enjoy the
way it feels, musically and lyrically.</p></li>
<li><p><em>My Love</em> - This one is very tasty. It is sweet and it delights me and it makes me float
and it carries that playful, beautiful feeling that comes at the start of a relationship with it and
I am enraptured by it. This may be my favorite from the list, but don't hold me to that.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Mother We Share</em> - I feel very energized by this one, and I like the lyrics, and the
catchiness. It is one that I feel like I need to listen to many more times.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Muddy Waters</em> - Slow and compelling. And her voice is wonderful. It sinks into my soul. I really
enjoyed this and I have to listen to more from LP.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Breezeblocks</em> - I mentioned the sound of the language before, and this one is in
English, but the sound of the English is captivating and fits the song like a glove.
I like the imagery and it's just fun.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Excuses</em> - This feels like many songs that I like. I kept backing it up and listening to
this song again. I probably replayed it more than any of these songs.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Lost</em> - So, I had considered a remix of "Thinkin Bout You" that I like for your playlist,
but I had never heard this song and I really, really like it. It's got a lot going on, and I enjoy that.</p></li>
<li><p><em>40 Day Dream</em> - I like the mix of feelings from this one. It has a bar band feel, but
then is so much smarter and more interesting. I plan to listen to more songs from them.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Ride</em> - There is a theme here of songs that, I don't know how to put it,
defy expectations, or maybe categorization. This one grew on me after the first
listening. It has worked its way into my heart.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Ready</em> - What finish! I used the word compelling before, but this one turns compelling up to
eleven. It has a visceral appeal, and it is totally ecstatic music. I really enjoyed
this one and I listened to it several times. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Favorites are difficult but, if I <em>have to</em>: <em>Back Pocket, My Love, Ready, Daqat, My Type</em></p>

<p>Thank you again for this playlist. I really am so grateful for it and I love that we are sharing these!</p>
